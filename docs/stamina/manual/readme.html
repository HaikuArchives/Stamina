<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>v1.4 - &copy; 1998-1999, Sylvain Demongeot</H4>

<H3>What is Stamina &amp; Charisma?</H3>

<P>Stamina is a handy utility for capturing web sites onto your hard disk.
You can browse the captured files offline through Charisma, a personal proxy
server. Charisma will also fetch and cache unavailable data.</P>

<P>Stamina &amp; Charisma v1.4 only run under BeOS
R4 and later versions. They run best with NetPositive 2.0.</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Launch Stamina by double-clicking its icon.
  <LI>If you have not registered yet, click the <B>Later</B> button in the
  registration window.
  <LI>Fill in the <B>From</B> field with the URL of the site you want to
  capture.
  <LI>Fill in the other options according to your mood (see details below).
  <LI>Click on the <B>Start</B> button.
  <LI>Wait until Stamina has finished (or press <B>Stop</B> when you have
  enough).
  <LI>That's all.
</UL>

<P><IMG SRC="images/staminarunning.gif" WIDTH="366" HEIGHT="261" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>During the capture, you can't change the options, but you can watch the
process in the <B>Stats</B> tab. If errors are encountered, they are logged
to the bottom of the window.</P>

<P>You can also start more captures by asking for a <B>New Window</B> in
the <B>File</B> menu. But watch out for your bandwidth.</P>

<P>Do you wish to grab the site that is currently displayed in NetPositive's
window? Pull <B>Get URL from Net+</B> in the <B>Edit</B> menu. This will
get the URL for you. If there are several NetPositive windows open, this
command will cycle through them.</P>

<TD WIDTH="50%"><P>This tells Stamina where to go. If <B>Depth</B> is set to 0, only the
page with the given URL will be captured (with its images and all the tra-la-la).
If <B>Depth</B> is set to 1, the pages directly linked to this one will
be captured, and so on.</P>

<P>If <B>Same server</B> is chosen, links to other servers will be ignored,
and if <B>Downwards</B> is demanded, only sub-directories of the base directory
will be explored.</TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="50%"><P>The trickiest is in <B>Smart Refresh</B>. If a site has already been
visited by Stamina, Stamina will check that old files are not out of date.
For instance, if you select <B>After 1 week</B>, Stamina will check all
files that have not been checked for 1 week. <B>Always</B> means &quot;always
check&quot;. <B>Dumb</B> means &quot;always retrieve document, even if it
seams up-to-date&quot; (this may help if your cache is corrupted).</P>

<P><B>Max connections</B> is the maximum number of simultaneous connections
to the Internet.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>All these options may be saved for future re-use (item <B>Save</B> in

Stamina file and clicking <B>Start</B>.</P>

<P>The captured files are carefully strored according to their origin host
and hierarchy in a folder named <B>/boot/home/theWWW</B>. You can try to
view them with Net+ from there, but it is not a very good idea, since absolute
links (containing <B>http://</B>) will not point to the cached data. This
is where the Charisma stuff starts.</TD>

<H3>NetPositive autosettings</H3>

<P>When <B>Net+ Autosettings</B> is enabled in Charisma's <B>Settings</B>
menu, Charisma will automatically tell <B>NetPositive 2.0</B> to use Charisma
as a proxy server. This results in NetPositive's settings window popping
briefly. Charisma will also re-configure NetPositive to normal use when
it quits or when it goes into <B>Disabled</B> mode.</P>

<P>If this script magic fails (new version of NetPositive...), you must
configure NetPositive yourself: enable proxies, set the HTTP proxy to be
<B>127.0.0.1</B>, and the HTTP port to be <B>8080</B>. This also applies
if you use some browser other than NetPositive.</P>

<H3>Charisma's modes</H3>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Disabled</B>: use this mode if you want to browse the Web directly.
  Your browser will not use Charisma as a proxy, and no file will be added
  to your Charisma web cache. Typically, you'll use <B>Disabled</B> if you
  have troubles with forms, or if you want to use NetPositive's FTP.
  <LI><B>Offline</B>: use this mode if you want to browse sites that you
  have captured through Stamina or Charisma. Charisma will not attempt to
  connect to the origin server if the file is not available in the cache.
  In such a case it will, however, offer you to go into online mode (see
  picture below). Typically, you'll use <B>Offline</B> when you're not connected
  to the internet.
  <LI><B>Online</B>: use this mode if you want to browse both cached and
  unvisited sites. All new data will be added to the cache. Charisma will
  also refresh already cached data after some delay, as set in the &quot;Refresh&quot;
  menu (this is the same menu as in Stamina). Typically, you'll use <B>Online</B>
  when you're connected to the internet.

<H3>Other features</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>You can test that Charisma is correctly interfaced with NetPositive
  (or any other browser) by simply typing <B>charisma</B> as the URL. Charisma
  will respond with a test page.
  <LI>You can minimize Charisma 's Window by double-clicking its title bar.
  Double-click its border to un-minimize it.
  <LI>You can change the web directory's location for both Stamina and Charisma
  by pulling <B>Select Web Directory</B> in Charisma's <B>Settings</B> menu.
  This is useful if you want to store your data on some volume other than
  the boot volume.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="tips"></A>Tips and troubleshooting</H2>

<H3>Auto-startup</H3>

<P>If you want Charisma to start automatically after system boot, append
the following line to the file <B>/boot/home/config/boot/UserBootscript</B>:</P>

<P><TT>Launch application/x-vnd.SD-Charisma</TT></P>

<H3>Cache jam</H3>

<P>If your page fails to update although you have just refreshed it with
Stamina, or if your page displays &quot;not in Charisma's cache&quot; although
you know it actually is, it may be due to cache inconsistancy between Charisma
and your bowser. Indeed, every browser including NetPositive has its own
private cache which may contain older data. Try to refresh your page with
your browser's <B>reload</B> button. If this fails, clear your browser's
cache.</P>

<H3>File jam</H3>

<P>If your page or image has displayed without an error message but it is
dirty or incomplete, then perhaps the corresponding file is damaged in such
a way that Charisma can't know it is. There are two ways to fix this: either
you manually remove the damaged file, or you set <B>Refresh</B> to be <B>dumb
</B>(in Charisma), and you reload the file (then reset <B>Refresh</B> to
normal, otherwise all files will always be reloaded).</P>
